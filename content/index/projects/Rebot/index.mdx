Fun fact: Hyperthymesia is a condition that results in a bulletproof memory. Sadly, not everyone has it. Instead people
use alarms, reminders, etc. However, the most effective way I've found is to be reminded via the most used app on almost
everyone's phone: WhatsApp. That's right, Rebot is your regular reminder tool, but on WhatsApp. You can now create, view
and delete reminders, directly from WhatsApp.
