Teachable machine is an amazing tool developed by Google that makes classification based Machine Learning
accessible for everyone. Integrating it into a Chrome extension allows an almost hands-free usage of Google Meet
(Workspace Edition). This extension might help people with reduced motor function, or those who are using Google Meet
far away from their system. There is a slight caveat. The dataset that was used to train this has a sample size
of one. So if one needs to use this, they need to retrain the model with their own webcam data for accuracy.
