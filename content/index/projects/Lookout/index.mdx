Do you zone out in the middle of your video call? Or are you super productive and want to multitask by attending the
call & doing something else? Then Lookout aims to solve this issue by providing a lookout for you (i.e., the text you specify)
on Google Meet! It works by parsing the captions and alerts when it detects your keyword.
