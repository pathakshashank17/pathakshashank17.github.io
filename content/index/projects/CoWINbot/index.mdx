In these unprecedented times, vaccination against CoVID-19 has turned out to be the only way to be _relatively_ safe
these days. However, in India, catching a glimpse of an empty slot, let alone booking one has become a game of the
fastest finger first. Therefore, I decided to build this Node.js based WhatsApp bot that can check, track and inform
about empty vaccination slots.
