Namaste, I'm Shashank Pathak, a passionate developer keen on building interesting and useful stuff. Currently, I'm pursuing B.Tech in Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi. Apart from development, my interest draws me towards astronomy 👨‍🚀, photography 📷 and music 🎧.

I grew up in Bokaro Steel City, Jharkhand. There, I completed my schooling from Delhi Public School, passing out in the year 2018 with flying colors.
